#Ciel and Menu .
---

* This is my fourth completed Problem from the many PS's of CodeChef.com .
* This was not a challenging problem but a one to keep practicing .
* I used two other  libraries than the usual one that is the  ' iostream ' library .
* The other two libraries are : ' string ' and ' cstdlib ' .
* It was fun doing it and included one of my favourite concept of string manipulation .
* This has around 200 submissions . 
* And yes,Even I am undergoing a learning procedure .
* So,suggestions are most welcome .
* Email me @ kaushikpeace@gmail.com .

###The Problem Statement is as follows :
***
 Chef Ciel likes 8. Ciel's restaurant has many menus whose prices are multiples of 8.
Now, Ciel has some digits written on a wooden board, and she'd like to cut the board to display prices in a new menu.
In how many ways can Ciel choose consecutive digits from the board which denote integer multiples of 8?

In this problem, an integer must not have leading zeros.
For example, 0, 8, 48, 1000 are integer multiples of 8, but 00, 5, 58, 01000 are not.<br>
<b>Input</b> 

An input contains a string S, which denotes digits written on the wooden board.<br>
<b>Output</b>

Print the number of ways in which Ciel can choose consecutive digits which denote integer multiples of 8.
Constraints

1 ≤ |S| ≤ 1000000 (106), where |S| means the length of S.
S doesn't contain non-digit charactors.<br>
<b>Sample Input</b>

5858

<b>Sample Output</b><br>
2
